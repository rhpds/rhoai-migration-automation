# Resolver — Workbenches

**rhai-cli signal:** `workload / notebook / *` — image-version, custom-image, stopped.

## Why

> Existing custom workbench images and RStudio images will fail due to routing conflicts with the new auth mechanism — they must be rebuilt. All running workbenches must be stopped before migration; unmigrated workbenches will experience redirection loops.
>
> — architectural-changes.md § *Networking and Authentication Changes*

> oauth-proxy is tightly coupled to the internal OpenShift OAuth Server and cannot support external Identity Providers. […] Custom workbench images built for the oauth-proxy flow will need to be rebuilt.
>
> — architectural-changes.md § *Authentication: oauth-proxy to kube-rbac-proxy*

The migration changes routing (Route → Gateway API) and auth (oauth-proxy → kube-rbac-proxy). Images built for 2.x embed the oauth-proxy sidecar config; under 3.x they hit redirect loops.

## Three distinct sub-issues

### 1. code-server workbenches must be on 2025.2 before upgrade

code-server workbenches on older image tags will break in 3.x. Update the Notebook CRs to the `2025.2` tag:

```
# List current code-server workbenches and their image tag
oc get notebooks -A -o json \
  | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image | test("code-?server")) | "\(.metadata.namespace)\t\(.metadata.name)\t\(.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image)"'

# For each one, patch to tag 2025.2 — example shown with oc set image-like patch:
NS=<namespace>; NAME=<notebook>
oc patch notebook "$NAME" -n "$NS" --type=json \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image","value":"image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/redhat-ods-applications/code-server-notebook:2025.2"}]'
```

### 2. RStudio workbenches must use the `latest` tag

RStudio images are built per-cluster via BuildConfigs (licensing constraint). The tag must be `latest` — the build recreates that tag after the 3.x upgrade.

```
# Ensure the BuildConfigs are present + latest build has succeeded
oc get bc -n redhat-ods-applications | grep rstudio
oc get is rstudio-rhel9 cuda-rstudio-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications

# List current RStudio notebooks
oc get notebooks -A -o json \
  | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image | test("rstudio")) | "\(.metadata.namespace)\t\(.metadata.name)\t\(.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image)"'

# Update each to the latest tag
NS=<namespace>; NAME=<notebook>
oc patch notebook "$NAME" -n "$NS" --type=json \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image","value":"image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/redhat-ods-applications/rstudio-rhel9:latest"}]'
```

Post-upgrade the image must be rebuilt (see architectural-changes.md § *Networking and Authentication Changes*); that step happens after the 3.3.2 upgrade itself.

### 3. Custom ("BYON") workbench images must be rebuilt for Gateway API + kube-rbac-proxy

For every custom ImageStream in `redhat-ods-applications` with labels `app.kubernetes.io/created-by: byon` and `opendatahub.io/notebook-image: "true"`:

```
# Enumerate BYON images (IS objects that may or may not have active Notebooks)
oc get imagestream -n redhat-ods-applications -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=byon \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,CREATOR:.metadata.annotations.opendatahub\.io/notebook-image-creator,URL:.metadata.annotations.opendatahub\.io/notebook-image-url'
```

Each owner must rebuild their Dockerfile to:

- Remove the oauth-proxy sidecar config; 3.x uses kube-rbac-proxy injected by the platform.
- Use path-based routing via Gateway API (3.x), not the 2.x Route-based path handling.

The owner pushes the new image (new tag, by convention `<original-tag>-gw` for "gateway-ready"), updates the ImageStream, and recreates the Notebook. Red Hat does not provide an automated rebuild — this is an application-owner task. Survey with:

```
# For each BYON IS, print who owns it (from the notebook-image-creator annotation)
oc get imagestream -n redhat-ods-applications -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=byon \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.annotations.opendatahub\.io/notebook-image-creator}{"\n"}{end}'
```

> Don't double-count Pipeline runtime images. ImageStreams matching `^runtime-` (e.g. `runtime-pytorch`, `runtime-rocm-tensorflow`) are AI-Pipeline runtime base images, not workbenches. The operator auto-updates them on upgrade — exclude from the BYON list above.

#### Reuse the same `-gw` image across multiple clusters (dev → preprod → prod)

Once a `-gw` image is built and tested on one cluster, it can be reused as-is on other clusters with the same source image — no rebuild per cluster. Pull from the source cluster's internal registry (or any external registry the image was pushed to), then push to the target's internal registry:

```
# On the target cluster
SRC_IMAGE=<dev-internal-registry>/redhat-ods-applications/<imagestream>:<tag>-gw
INTERNAL_REG=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')

podman login "${INTERNAL_REG}" -u "$(oc whoami)" -p "$(oc whoami -t)" --tls-verify=false
podman pull "$SRC_IMAGE"
podman tag  "$SRC_IMAGE" "${INTERNAL_REG}/redhat-ods-applications/<imagestream>:<tag>-gw"
podman push "${INTERNAL_REG}/redhat-ods-applications/<imagestream>:<tag>-gw" --tls-verify=false

# Import as a tag on the target cluster's ImageStream
oc tag "${INTERNAL_REG}/redhat-ods-applications/<imagestream>:<tag>-gw" \
       "<imagestream>:<tag>-gw" \
       -n redhat-ods-applications --reference-policy=local --insecure=true
```

`--reference-policy=local` makes the IS pin the image to the local registry (rather than re-resolving against the source registry, which the target cluster can't reach). `--insecure=true` is needed for the default OpenShift internal registry self-signed cert.

#### Known RStudio `-gw` build gotchas

If you're building the RStudio `-gw` image yourself (or auditing one), two specific NGINX config bugs to watch for:

1. **Redirect strips `NB_PREFIX`.** The stock RStudio image redirects to `/rstudio/` without the workbench's `NB_PREFIX`, which works under 2.x Routes but produces "page not found" under 3.x Gateway API path-based routing. Fix: keep `NB_PREFIX` in every `Location:` header NGINX emits.
2. **`/api` endpoint `SCRIPT_FILENAME` resolution.** An inline rewrite + FastCGI for `${NB_PREFIX}/api` breaks `SCRIPT_FILENAME` because the variable depends on the NGINX `root` directive in the original `/api/` block. Fix: revert `/api` endpoints to a 302 redirect pattern, not an inline rewrite. Symptom of the bug: pod 2/2 Ready but readiness probe returns 403; users see "Service Unavailable".

Both bugs were observed in real-world `-gw` builds and require a rebuild after fixing the NGINX config.

#### RStudio is Tech Preview and not built by default

The `rstudio-rhel9` and `cuda-rstudio-rhel9` ImageStreams ship with the RHOAI operator but have **no built tag** — the BuildConfig requires RHEL subscription credentials and must be triggered manually:

```
# Check whether the BuildConfigs have ever produced a usable tag
oc get is rstudio-rhel9 cuda-rstudio-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,TAGS:.status.tags[*].tag'
# Empty TAGS column = never built. Trigger:
oc start-build rstudio-server-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications --follow
oc start-build cuda-rstudio-server-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications --follow
```

Plan separately: building RStudio for the first time usually needs the cluster admin to attach a RHEL entitlement to the cluster, which is its own ticket.

#### GPU workbench using a sha256 digest

Some users hard-code the image as `image: ...@sha256:<digest>` in the Notebook spec. Two problems:

- The digest can disappear from the source registry (image GC, retention policy) — workbench then fails to start.
- It's invisible to BYON discovery (`oc get is -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=byon` won't list it).

After the upgrade — or as part of pre-upgrade hygiene — switch to an ImageStream tag reference. Example for a CUDA Jupyter workbench:

```
NS=<ns>; NAME=<notebook>
oc patch notebook "$NAME" -n "$NS" --type=merge -p '{
  "spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{
    "name":"'"$NAME"'",
    "image":"image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/redhat-ods-applications/custom-rh-cuda-jupyter-datascience-py311-main:jupyter-datascience-c9s-py311-cuda-devel-main"
  }]}}}}'
```

Find sha256-pinned notebooks first:

```
oc get notebooks -A -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image | test("@sha256:")) | "\(.metadata.namespace)/\(.metadata.name)  image=\(.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image)"'
```

#### Image registry change between 2.x tags

The OOTB workbench images switched their source registry between tag generations:

| Tag | Source registry |
|---|---|
| `1.2`–`2024.2` | `quay.io/modh/*` or `quay.io/opendatahub/*` (community) |
| `2025.1`+ | `registry.redhat.io/rhoai/odh-workbench-*` (GA) |
| `2025.2`+ | Same `registry.redhat.io/...` plus Python 3.12 / UBI 9 base |

Both remain functional after the 3.3.2 upgrade. The migration just bumps the operator-managed ImageStreams; existing Notebook CRs keep their existing image refs unless the owner explicitly bumps the tag.

### 4. All workbenches must be Stopped before the upgrade

**rhai-cli signal:** `workload / notebook / stopped`.

```
# Survey which are running — by pod count, not annotation (see Verify note below)
for nb in $(oc get notebooks -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'); do
  ns="${nb%/*}"; name="${nb##*/}"
  pods=$(oc -n "$ns" get pods -l notebook-name="$name" --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  [ "$pods" -gt 0 ] && echo "$nb has $pods pod(s) running"
done

# Stop one — set the annotation to an ISO timestamp (this is what the dashboard does)
NS=<namespace>; NAME=<notebook>
oc annotate notebook "$NAME" -n "$NS" \
  kubeflow-resource-stopped="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --overwrite

# Stop all (be sure — this disconnects active users)
STAMP=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
for row in $(oc get notebooks -A --no-headers | awk '{print $1"/"$2}'); do
  oc annotate notebook "${row##*/}" -n "${row%%/*}" \
    kubeflow-resource-stopped="$STAMP" --overwrite
done
```

Expect to do this in the maintenance window itself, not earlier — users will lose active sessions.

## Verify

The notebook controller treats `kubeflow-resource-stopped` as "stopped if present and non-empty" — the dashboard sets it to an ISO timestamp, not the literal `"true"`. Filters that check for `== "true"` will report stopped notebooks as still running. The reliable check is **pod count**:

```
# No workbenches still running — pod-count gate (the rhai-cli check uses this signal too)
for nb in $(oc get notebooks -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'); do
  ns="${nb%/*}"; name="${nb##*/}"
  pods=$(oc -n "$ns" get pods -l notebook-name="$name" --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  [ "$pods" -gt 0 ] && echo "$nb still has $pods pod(s)"
done
# empty output = all stopped
```

For the annotation-only check (faster but blind to "annotation missing entirely yet pod is gone" cases):

```
oc get notebooks -A -o json \
  | jq -r '.items[] | select((.metadata.annotations."kubeflow-resource-stopped" // "") == "") | "\(.metadata.namespace)/\(.metadata.name)"'
# empty output = all stopped via annotation
```

## After

Re-run `rhai-cli lint --target-version 3.3.2 --checks "*notebook*"`.
