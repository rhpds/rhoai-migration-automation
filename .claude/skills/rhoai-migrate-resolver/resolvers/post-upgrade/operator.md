# Resolver — OpenShift AI Operator (post-upgrade)

*Covers migration guide §4.1 — citation only; user-facing label is `[operator]`.*

Verify the 3.3.2 operator, DSC/DSCI, pods, and Gateway. Covers the platform-level health check that every other post-upgrade task assumes is green.

## Why

The 2.25.4 operator and 3.3.2 operator have fundamentally different reconcile models — chapter 3's in-place upgrade uninstalls the old CSV and installs the new one in the same namespace. If the DSC is not `Ready` after the upgrade, every other component resolver will hit transient failures as the operator replays its reconcile loop. Validate the operator first, then move on.

Kueue and OSSM3 get a specific callout below because both are known to block the operator from reaching `Ready` if the pre-upgrade step was skipped.

## Verify

```
# Operator + CSV
oc get csv -n redhat-ods-operator -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,PHASE:.status.phase,DISPLAY:.spec.displayName'
# expect: rhods-operator.3.3.2, Succeeded. No rhods-operator.2.* CSV should remain.

# DSC + DSCI phases — both Ready
oc get dsc -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase'
oc get dsci -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase'

# Operator-namespace pods
oc get pods -n redhat-ods-operator -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,READY:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status,STATUS:.status.phase'

# Applications-namespace pods
oc get pods -n redhat-ods-applications -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,READY:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status,STATUS:.status.phase'

# Gateway API readiness (3.x routes via Gateway API, not Routes)
oc get gatewayconfigs --all-namespaces -o wide
# expect: default-gateway READY=True
```

## Kueue recovery (if pre-upgrade Kueue step was skipped)

If `KueueReady=False` with message `Kueue managementState Managed is not supported, please use Removed or Unmanaged`:

```
oc get dsc -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="KueueReady")].status}{"\n"}{.items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="KueueReady")].message}{"\n"}'
```

Recover by flipping Kueue to `Removed` post-upgrade — same patch as in the pre-upgrade resolver:

```
oc patch $(oc get dsc -o name | head -n1) --type=merge -p '{
  "spec": { "components": { "kueue": { "managementState": "Removed" } } }
}'
```

Then verify:

```
oc get dsc -o jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="KueueReady")]}{.status} {.reason}{"\n"}{end}'
# expect: True  OR  False Removed
```

Kueue features can be re-enabled post-upgrade via the Red Hat Build of Kueue operator (see architectural-changes.md § *Workload Scheduling: Kueue Transition*) — that's a separate setup step after the migration.

## GatewayConfig stuck "Not Ready" — NetworkPolicy webhook blocks it

**Symptom:** post-upgrade, `oc get gatewayconfig default-gateway --all-namespaces -o wide` shows `READY: False`, and the dashboard URL doesn't resolve.

**Cause:** the RHOAI 3.x GatewayConfig reconciler creates a NetworkPolicy in the `openshift-ingress` namespace to allow ingress traffic to `data-science-gateway`. On clusters with an SRE-managed admission webhook (typical name: `sre-networkpolicies-validation`) restricting NetworkPolicy creation in `openshift-*` namespaces, that POST gets rejected → GatewayConfig sits Not Ready forever.

This has been observed on multiple managed-OpenShift clusters with SRE-managed admission webhooks. Reproducible enough to call a known issue rather than environment-specific — if your cluster has any webhook restricting NetworkPolicy creation in `openshift-*` namespaces, expect to need this fix.

**Fix:** disable the operator-managed NetworkPolicy for the GatewayConfig. The cluster's ingress isolation continues to be enforced by whatever the SRE webhook set up; you're just opting RHOAI out of also writing one.

```
oc patch gatewayconfig default-gateway --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"networkPolicy":{"ingress":{"enabled":false}}}}'
```

Verify:

```
oc get gatewayconfig default-gateway -o jsonpath='phase={.status.phase}  ingressMode={.status.ingressMode}{"\n"}'
# expect: phase=Ready  ingressMode=OcpRoute
```

If you don't run an SRE webhook (most non-managed-OpenShift clusters), the default `networkPolicy.ingress.enabled=true` is fine and you don't need this patch.

## Disconnected-cluster OSSM3 failure

> After upgrading on a disconnected cluster, the `servicemeshoperator3` subscription can fail, leaving DSCI stuck `<not Ready>` and `data-science-gateway` with `Unknown` status.

This is a known issue with a KB article — do not try to resolve inline:

- Confirm the symptom:
  ```
  oc get subscription servicemeshoperator3 -n openshift-operators -o jsonpath='{.status.state}{"\n"}'
  oc get dsci -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.phase}{"\n"}'
  oc get gateway data-science-gateway -n openshift-ingress -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Programmed")].status}{"\n"}'
  ```

## Dashboard URL 404 after upgrade

3.x uses Gateway API — the old 2.x Route URL is gone. Users with bookmarks will get 404. Fix:

1. Get the new dashboard URL:
   ```
   oc get gatewayconfigs -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.spec.hostname}{"\n"}{end}'
   ```
2. Communicate the new URL to users. See [Resolving dashboard URL 404 errors after upgrading from 2.x to 3.x](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7137771) for the redirect option.
