# Resolver — Kueue

**rhai-cli signal:** `component / kueue / *` with impact `critical` or `prohibited`.

## Why

> **Critical:** The Kueue component management state must be set to "Removed" *before* upgrading. Leaving it as "Managed" causes **unrecoverable cluster instability**.
>
> — architectural-changes.md § *Workload Scheduling: Kueue Transition*

RHOAI 2.25 deprecated the embedded Kueue distribution; RHOAI 3.3 removes it. The failure mode if Kueue is left `Managed` at upgrade time is **cluster-wide, not RHOAI-scoped**: the Kueue admission webhook intercepts Job creation across every namespace. During the OLM-managed operator upgrade, the running webhook server and the new Kueue CRDs fall out of schema-version sync, and the webhook then rejects or mangles Job submissions for any workload on the cluster — RHOAI or otherwise. That includes OLM bundle unpacks, image builds, CronJobs, and other tenants' batch workloads. The only documented recovery once this is in progress is an etcd restore (see [BACKUP-RESTORE.md](../../../../BACKUP-RESTORE.md) Scenario B). After migration, Kueue features can be re-enabled via the **Red Hat Build of Kueue** (RHBoK) operator — but that's a post-upgrade step.

**Upstream fix tracking:** RHOAIENG-48690 (root cause — Closed), RHOAIENG-52872 (webhook fix re-enable — Unassigned at the time of writing), RHAISTRAT-1711 (overall strategy: 2.25.x webhook backport + 3.5 top-level Kueue integration for InferenceService / LLMInferenceService / Notebooks). Until the 2.25.x backport ships, the manual `Removed` step below is the only safeguard.

## Preserve your queue frameworks (optional but recommended)

If you have workloads using Kueue and want the framework list to survive into RHBoK post-upgrade, annotate the config map before flipping management state:

```
oc annotate configmap kueue-manager-config -n redhat-ods-applications \
  opendatahub.io/managed=false --overwrite
```

This tells the RHOAI operator not to purge the `kueue-manager-config` ConfigMap when Kueue becomes `Removed`.

## Commands to run

Set `kueue.managementState` to `Removed` on the DSC:

```
oc patch $(oc get dsc -o name | head -n1) --type=merge -p '{
  "spec": { "components": { "kueue": { "managementState": "Removed" } } }
}'
```

> Note: `oc get dsc -o name` already returns `datasciencecluster.datasciencecluster.opendatahub.io/<name>`, so the `dsc` argument is omitted from `oc patch` to avoid "there is no need to specify a resource type as a separate argument when passing arguments in resource/name form".

## Verify

```
# spec should say Removed
oc get dsc -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.components.kueue.managementState}'; echo

# status should confirm (KueueReady=True means Removed handled cleanly; False with reason Removed is also OK)
oc get dsc -o jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="KueueReady")]}{.status} {.reason}{"\n"}{end}'

# kueue pods gone from redhat-ods-applications
oc get pods -n redhat-ods-applications -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kueue
```

## Callouts

- **Do not** skip directly to uninstalling the Red Hat Build of Kueue if you have it installed separately — that's for external users. The `Removed` state above handles only the RHOAI-embedded Kueue.
- If you had embedded Kueue (`Managed`), migrating to the external Red Hat Build of Kueue is a separate pre-migration step and involves switching `managementState` to `Unmanaged` first, installing the external operator, then setting `Removed`. See migration guide §2.2 for the exact sequence.
- **Known edge case — RHOAIENG-61489 (New):** the `Managed → Unmanaged` transition can stall. If you're using the `Managed → Unmanaged → install RHBoK → Removed` sequence rather than going straight to `Removed`, re-run the Verify block above and confirm the DSC `KueueReady` condition has settled before installing RHBoK. If `Unmanaged` won't complete, opening a support case is safer than proceeding.

## After

Re-run `rhai-cli lint --target-version 3.3.2 --checks "*kueue*"` to confirm the check passes.
