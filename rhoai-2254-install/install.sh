# Driver: installs RHOAI 2.25.6 in its pre-migration ("before") state so the
# 2.25.6 -> 3.3.3 migration procedure has something to operate on.
#
# Phases:
#   05-gpu         - optional NFD + NVIDIA GPU Operator. Skipped by default (samples are CPU-only).
#                    Set INSTALL_GPU=auto or INSTALL_GPU=1 to install. See 05-gpu/run.sh.
#   10-operators   - installs Service Mesh v2, Serverless, Authorino, RHOAI 2.25.6 operator (pinned)
#   20-dsc         - creates DSCInitialization + DataScienceCluster with all components Managed,
#                    KServe in Serverless mode, ModelMesh Managed
#   30-samples     - deploys flag-gated sample workloads that exercise every §2.x "before" step
#
# Toggle individual sample workloads with INSTALL_* env vars (all default to 1).
# See 30-samples/run.sh for the full list.
