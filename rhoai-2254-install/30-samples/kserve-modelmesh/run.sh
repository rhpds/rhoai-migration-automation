#   podsPerRuntime: 1     — required on a RWO storage class (gp3-csi, etc.) to avoid
#                           a Multi-Attach race when the controller surges a 2nd pod
# The modelmesh-controller reads this config at startup, so restart it to pick it up
# (the controller is already running from the DSC reconcile in phase 20).
