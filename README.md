# rhoai-migrations

Scripts and manifests for standing up a Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) cluster in a known "before" state so the RHOAI **2.25.4 → 3.3.2** migration procedure can be exercised end-to-end.

The install drops a cluster into exactly the configuration that each §2.x step of the migration guide expects to operate on. Once it's up, you run the migration assessment (chapter 1) and walk through the upgrade (chapter 2) against real workloads.

## What it installs

Everything lives under [rhoai-2254-install/](rhoai-2254-install/) and runs in four phases:

| Phase | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [05-gpu/](rhoai-2254-install/05-gpu/) | Optional NFD + NVIDIA GPU Operator. **Skipped by default** — samples are CPU-only. Opt in with `INSTALL_GPU=auto` or `INSTALL_GPU=1`. |
| [10-operators/](rhoai-2254-install/10-operators/) | Service Mesh v2, Serverless, Authorino, and the RHOAI 2.25.4 operator (pinned) |
| [20-dsc/](rhoai-2254-install/20-dsc/) | `DSCInitialization` + `DataScienceCluster` — all components Managed, KServe in Serverless mode, ModelMesh Managed |
| [30-samples/](rhoai-2254-install/30-samples/) | Flag-gated sample workloads covering every §2.x "Before upgrade" step: workbenches (incl. a custom upstream Jupyter image), BYON orphan ImageStream, KServe (Serverless + ModelMesh + RawDeployment), LLM ISVC, Ray, KFTO, TrustyAI, AI Pipelines, Feature Store (Feast), Llama Stack, Model Registry |

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift **4.19.9 or newer** (hard requirement from migration guide §1.2)
- Cluster pull secret with auth for `registry.redhat.io` — RHOAI, Service Mesh 2, Serverless, and NFD all pull from there. RHDP / sandbox clusters have this pre-wired; bare OCP installs need `oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config ...`
- An OpenShift cluster you are logged into (`oc whoami` works) with cluster-admin
- `oc`, `jq`, `envsubst` on your PATH
- A default `StorageClass`

The preflight check in [lib/common.sh](rhoai-2254-install/lib/common.sh) verifies OCP login, default StorageClass, and tool presence before anything is applied.

## Usage

Install everything:

```sh
cd rhoai-2254-install
./install.sh
```

Skip or override individual phases and samples via environment variables:

```sh
INSTALL_RAY=0 \
INSTALL_TRUSTYAI=0 \
  ./install.sh
```

Sample flags (`INSTALL_RAY`, `INSTALL_WORKBENCHES`, etc.) all default to `1`. Full list is at the top of [30-samples/run.sh](rhoai-2254-install/30-samples/run.sh). If a single sample fails, the phase keeps going and the failed samples are reported at the end — rerun just that one with `./30-samples/<name>/run.sh`.

### Reproducing a source cluster from an rhai-cli assessment

`install-from-assessment.sh` takes an `rhai-cli lint --output yaml` assessment file and runs `install.sh` with matching env vars — useful for building a test cluster that would yield a similar assessment report (same migration issues and blockers), so you can rehearse the migration against a representative shape without copying any source-cluster data.

```sh
cd rhoai-2254-install
./install-from-assessment.sh path/to/rhai-cli-output.yaml --dry-run   # see what it will do
./install-from-assessment.sh path/to/rhai-cli-output.yaml             # run it
```

The wrapper prints the derived `INSTALL_*` and `DSC_*_STATE` env vars before handing off to `install.sh`. See [examples/rhoai-upgrade.yml](rhoai-2254-install/examples/rhoai-upgrade.yml) for a sample input.

**What it reproduces:** per-operator install toggles (SM v2 / Serverless / Authorino), DSC/DSCI component management states, and per-sample-family enable/disable (if no Ray workloads on the source cluster, no Ray samples installed on the target).

**What it does NOT reproduce** (Tier 1 limitations): exact namespace names, specific model storage URIs, deprecated-schema-field injection (e.g. DSPA `.spec.apiServer.managedPipelines.instructLab`). The wrapper prints a "cannot reproduce" summary at the end listing any such issues from the source assessment.

`INSTALL_GPU` is tri-state; all samples are CPU-only so GPU is opt-in:

- `0` (default) — skip the GPU operator phase entirely.
- `auto` — install NFD + NVIDIA GPU Operator only if the cluster has GPU hardware but no driver yet (no node has `nvidia.com/gpu` allocatable).
- `1` — force install.

Tear it all down (best-effort, reverse order):

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

`uninstall.sh` does not remove cluster-wide CRDs — if you need a guaranteed-clean slate, reinstall against a fresh cluster.

## Expected "not Ready" states

A successful install leaves two workloads in non-Ready states on purpose — don't chase them:

- **RStudio workbench** stays Stopped. The `rstudio-rhel9` ImageStream ships with no built tag; an admin has to run its BuildConfig (licensing dependency) before it can start. Realistic pre-migration state: the Notebook exists but isn't running.
- **ModelMesh ISVC** (`my-modelmesh-isvc`) reports `Ready=False`. Its `storage-config` Secret points at a dummy S3 endpoint. Migration tooling only needs the ISVC + ServingRuntime to exist to detect them; actual model loading is out of scope.

## After the install

1. (Optional but recommended for rehearsal) **Take a backup** so you can roll the cluster back and re-run the migration. See [BACKUP-RESTORE.md](BACKUP-RESTORE.md) for the four-layer approach (etcd, OADP, RHOAI config export, rhai-cli helpers) and a restore drill.
2. Run the migration assessment (`rhai-cli lint --target-version 3.3.2`).
3. Resolve every blocker — the [rhoai-migrate-resolver](.claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/) skill walks you through the pre-upgrade tasks step-by-step.
4. Run the upgrade itself.
5. Walk through post-upgrade tasks — the same skill covers this phase.

## Guided migration (Claude Code skill)

A Claude Code skill, [rhoai-migrate-resolver](.claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/), walks a cluster administrator through **both** sides of the migration:

- **Pre-upgrade tasks** — resolve every blocker reported by `rhai-cli lint --target-version 3.3.2`.
- **Post-upgrade tasks** — verify the freshly-upgraded 3.3.2 cluster and walk each component's finalization work.

The skill is **read-only on the cluster by default** — it recommends `oc` commands and explains *why* each change is needed (each resolver embeds the architectural rationale inline). The user can opt into "execute mode" per-resolver by saying *"run the commands"* / *"just do it"*, in which case the skill runs them with pauses after destructive steps. See the *Hard rules* section in [SKILL.md](.claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/SKILL.md).

### Use the skill inside Claude Code

Open this project in Claude Code, then:

```
/rhoai-migrate-resolver
```

Claude will ask which phase you're in. For pre-upgrade it parses the `rhai-cli` output and walks through one resolver at a time. For post-upgrade, ask it to *walk me through post-upgrade tasks* — it runs the validator, groups issues by component, and walks them one at a time.

### Or run the three helper scripts directly

All three are self-contained bash — no Claude Code required — and only use read-only `oc get` / `oc describe`:

```sh
# Before you start — platform prereqs (OCP version, pull secret, StorageClass, DSC present)
bash .claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/scripts/prereqs.sh

# After pre-upgrade prep — is every migration blocker resolved?
bash .claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/scripts/validate.sh

# After the upgrade — is the 3.3.2 cluster healthy and are the post-upgrade tasks complete?
bash .claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/scripts/post-upgrade-validate.sh
```

Each exits `0` only if every check PASSes. Run `validate.sh` / `post-upgrade-validate.sh` *with* `rhai-cli lint`, not instead of it — they cross-check each other.

The post-upgrade validator prefixes each output line with a component label in brackets — `[operator]`, `[model-serving]`, `[workbenches]`, `[ray]`, `[trustyai]`, `[pipelines]`, `[feast]`, `[registry]`, `[llama-stack]`, `[kfto]`. Each label maps 1:1 to a resolver filename under [resolvers/post-upgrade/](.claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/resolvers/post-upgrade/).

### What the skill covers

- **Pre-upgrade resolvers:** [resolvers/README.md](.claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/resolvers/README.md) maps `rhai-cli` output `(GROUP, KIND, CHECK)` rows to a fix. Covers Kueue removal, KServe Serverless/ModelMesh conversion, Service Mesh 2 / Serverless / standalone Authorino uninstall, workbench image rebuilds, TrustyAI + Ray + Llama Stack backups, LLMInferenceService RHCL+template setup, and more.
- **Post-upgrade resolvers:** [resolvers/post-upgrade/README.md](.claude/skills/rhoai-migrate-resolver/resolvers/post-upgrade/README.md) covers every component task — operator + Gateway health, model-serving finalization + 503 troubleshooting, workbench patch + deferred migration, Ray cluster migration script, AI Hub registry/catalog, Feature Store, Llama Stack recreate-from-archive, AI Pipelines post-upgrade check, TrustyAI backups/Guardrails/data-restore/GPU-deadlock, KFTO PyTorchJob verification.
